# Bring the Bar Home

This was a static comp challenege to practice utilizing grid layouts and responsive design.

The spec for this challenge can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/m1-static-comp).
The project asked for a layout match of this comp, with creative liscence on the content, colors, and icons.

## Responsive Design
I created four breakpoints for this design - mainly for practice utilizing media queries. Additionally I challenged myself to use <code>grid-template-areas</code> as I hadn't used them before.
